the original dataset is not included in this repository, due to large volume that exeeded the minimum volume allowed in github 

eventid: A 12-digit Event ID system. First 8 numbers – date recorded “yyyymmdd”. Last 4 numbers – sequential case number for the given day (0001, 0002 etc).
iyear: This field contains the year in which the incident occurred.
imonth: This field contains the number of the month in which the incident occurred.
iday: This field contains the numeric day of the month on which the incident occurred.
extended: 1 = "Yes" The duration of an incident extended more than 24 hours. 0 = "No" The duration of an incident extended less than 24 hours.
country: This field identifies the country code
country_txt: This field identifies the country or location where the incident occurred.
region: This field identifies the region code based on 12 regions
alternative_txt
attacktype1_txt
attacktype2_txt
targtype1_txt
targsubtype1_txt




Thank you for providing the column names and brief explanations for the second dataset on global terrorism. Based on this information, here are some key questions you can explore and include in your data visualization report:

1. What is the trend in the number of terrorist incidents over the years (iyear)?
2. Are there any specific months (imonth) that have a higher incidence of terrorist attacks?
3. Is there a difference in the duration of terrorist incidents (extended) between countries?
4. Which countries have the highest and lowest number of terrorist incidents (country_txt)?
5. How do the regions (region) compare in terms of the frequency of terrorist attacks?
6. Are there any trends in the extended duration of incidents over the years?
7. Can we identify patterns or trends in the occurrence of terrorist incidents based on the day of the month (iday)?
8. Are there any correlations between the country's location (country_txt) and the region (region) where terrorist incidents occur?

These questions should help you get started with analyzing the global terrorism dataset. You can use various data visualization techniques, such as time series plots, bar charts, and maps, to explore and present the data effectively in your report. If you have more specific questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.
